    "### Mathematical Optimization Background\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization):\n",
    ">**Mathematical optimization** (alternatively spelled *optimisation*) or **mathematical programming** is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives. Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics. More generally, optimization includes finding \"best available\" values of some objective function given a defined domain (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains."

Thankfully, Google OR Tools comes with a way to check the status of our solution.  Above, we saved the output of our call to `solver.Solve()` in a variable called `status`.  Calling `solver.Solve()` returns an integer which represents the status of the solution (e.g. whether it's optimal, infeasible, etc.).  The `solver` class also comes with properties that represent each possible status.  We can compare the output of `solver.Solve()` to these properties to determine if an optimal solution was found."
